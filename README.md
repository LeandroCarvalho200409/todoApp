# Todo App

This is a Python project, which I developed using the framework Django and a little bit of bootstrap. It is a web-application where users can sign up and manage their todos. This is a project which I made 
for private purposes. Eventhough it is not completed yet (Most part of the design is still missing), it can already be used.

In future I will also develop a mobile application for this project using React-Native.
